ah shit here we go again

secret key = yauS1RGW7x2BaWf83bhPfF8ENQutcZ1W3fDFQEWA9xQm22ZkUNxomtHwyAc8zvQz
api key = Ucm9Bk2CxeXjBbkbYO8psVZpbJG6V1VUfco6AD3DVsFpipYyra2fsPrjLnRGLDo2

this is the second time i will be making this interface, fuck it, my life's a mess
anyway, if it is second time, it definetly has to be much much better than last time
points to remember:
    make it modular
    focus on variable names
    this is later going to run on a rasberry pi. write efficiently


things that is required
    - get historical data
    - get indicator data  
        last time things were quite dicey with limits and all that. keep it uniform this time
            - ichimoku
    - make a common interface for backtesting and live market
        should be modular
        different strategies could be loaded without any hassale
            -things passed in a strategy
                - data 


notes:
    Oct 17:
        i worked quite a lot today. but i was able to make as much progress. 
        i have discovered a better way to handle data.
        panda's dataframe. it's really nifty.
        makes everthing clean.
        anyway the indicator works and now only making the backtesting interface is left

step 1 : get historical data function
step 2 : make the ichimoku indicator
step 3 : make backtesting interface
step 4 : backtest the thought strategy
